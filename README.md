# Biscuit-Sales-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard
The Biscuit Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, focusing on key areas like revenue trends, distribution, and payment methods. It tracks revenue over time to identify growth patterns, while also analyzing how sales are distributed across different regions, highlighting high-performing locations.

1. Revenue Trend Analysis
This section of the dashboard will display a line chart showing the revenue trend over a specific time period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). It will help track how the sales of biscuits fluctuate over time, highlighting peaks and troughs. By using Excel’s Pivot Table and Line Chart, you can visualize:

Total Revenue Over Time: Track whether revenue is growing or declining.
Monthly/Quarterly Trends: Visualize monthly or quarterly revenue changes.
Growth Rate: Show the percentage change in revenue compared to the previous month/quarter to identify growth patterns.
2. Revenue Distribution by Location
A pie chart or bar chart can be used to represent how revenue is distributed across various regions or locations (e.g., North, South, East, West). This analysis helps to identify which locations are driving the most revenue.

Revenue by Region: Use Pivot Tables to calculate revenue by each location and display it as a pie chart for a visual representation of the percentage share of each region.
3. Sales Representative Performance
For tracking individual sales representative performance, you can create a bar chart that shows the total sales or revenue generated by each representative. This helps identify top performers and those who may need additional support.

Total Sales by Sales Rep: Track the total sales by each representative using a bar chart or column chart, helping to identify which sales rep has the highest contribution to overall sales.
Sales Targets vs. Actual: Include a gauge chart or performance indicator to show each rep’s performance relative to their sales targets.
4. Revenue by Payment Method
This section would highlight how different payment methods (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Online Payment) contribute to the overall revenue. A pie chart or stacked bar chart can be used to show the percentage distribution of each payment method.

Revenue by Payment Method: Use a pie chart or bar chart to illustrate how much revenue each payment method is generating. This provides insight into customer preferences and helps in understanding trends such as the increasing use of online payment methods.
